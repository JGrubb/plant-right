<h1>The PlantRight Spring Nursery Survey</h1>

<p>The <strong>PlantRight Spring Nursery Survey</strong> will be conducted each year with the help of the California Master Gardeners to gather information about the retail market for invasive plants in California. This information will be used help PlantRight focus its outreach efforts more effectively across California’s 13,000 plant retailers, wholesalers and growers. PlantRight is working collaboratively with the nursery industry and will not use the survey results publicly to implicate specific stores, companies or regions as sources of the problem.</p>

<p>PlantRight also wants to provide educational resources for Master Gardeners about the impact of invasive plants and how to choose beautiful non-invasive alternatives for their gardens. We are offering an educational webinar for Master Gardeners to learn about (1) which plants are invasive in California (2) how to avoid planting invasive plants in your garden and (3) about our partnership with the nursery industry to address the invasive plant issue. By participating in this webinar Master Gardeners will be eligible for “Continuing Education” credit.  At the end of the webinar, Master Gardeners will also have the option to find out more information about how to participate in the PlantRight Spring Nursery Survey and gain “Volunteer Hours”. This survey will be pivotal in helping the horticulture industry lead the way in preventing new introductions of invasive plants California. Participation in the survey is not required to attend the webinar.<p>
	
<p>Invasive plants are the second greatest threat to biodiversity worldwide and nearly half of the invasive plants found in California originally arrived through home gardens and landscaping.  By participating in this survey you will contribute to the preservation of California’s wildlands, help to solve a complex environmental issue, and become familiar with plants that are invasive in your area!</p>
